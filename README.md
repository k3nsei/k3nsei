### Hi, I'm Piotr 👋 👨‍💻

I'm a man of many talents, like a Swiss army knife! Commitment, passion and a desire to create something great are just a few of the things that drive me. While anything is possible, we need to ask ourselves: is it worth devoting our time to? Perhaps there's something else we can do to make the world a better place. Use your imagination and never stop dreaming!

### My motto
`The code is mightier than the sword`
