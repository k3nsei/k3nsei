### Hi, I'm Piotr 👋 👨‍💻

I'm like a Swiss army knife. A man of many talents. Commitment, passion and the desire to create something great are just a small part of my world. Anything is possible, but we have to ask ourselves one question. Is it worth our time? Maybe something else can be done that will make the world a better place? Just use your imagination and don't stop dreaming...

### My motto
`The code is mightier than the sword`
